I don't need to generate and store the actual key for session encryption. I can
just point the lib at a file and it will then take care of either reading from
that file or writing to it first.

Next step is to run migrations at app start and add the Litestream SQLite sync.
This will allow me to actually run the app on the server successfully and then
populate the DB from my local machine. I just need to run sync locally and
point it at the remote S3 bucket.
